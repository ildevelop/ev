				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Displayed on numerous websites across the world, these pay-per-click ads allow you to target customers who you believe are right for your product or service. The advantage is obvious. Rather than pay to post a generic ad, you instead pay only when somebody is interested enough to click your ad. This means the quality of your traffic skyrockets, and hopefully, if you&#8217;ve run your ad campaign properly, your profits, too.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Using Google AdWords PPC Advertising</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s easy to get your AdWords account setup. All you need to do to start your Google PPC campaign is open an account with Google and deposit some funds. It&#8217;s really that easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, you create your ad and send it out for the world to see. You should start getting clicks fairly quickly. The scope of these Google ads is vast, so straight away your business will be thrust into the limelight.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Google PPC Cost</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the trickiest aspects of Google PPC advertising is figuring out the cost-per-click and matching it up to your product conversion rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, if you pay $1 a click, but only one in ten clicks results in a sale, you&#8217;ll be paying $10 for every sale. If your profit margin is $30, that&#8217;s a good deal. If it&#8217;s only $12 though, you might want to tweak your campaign a little for better results.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Maximizing Efficiency</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s unlikely your first Google AdWords campaign will be a roaring success. Most people find theirs moves along fairly nicely, but doesn&#8217;t quite have the efficiency they&#8217;d like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, they usually choose to change something. It can be a little nerve wracking changing a formula that isn&#8217;t necessarily broken, but sometimes this is for the best. As you&#8217;re paying for each click, you&#8217;ll want to achieve maximum efficiency when possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the first things that&#8217;s changed is the wording of the ad. Google PPC advertising responds almost in real time, so you&#8217;ll be able to see whether or not your change is successful. You can also run a new ad in unison to see which of the two performs better.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Understanding Google PPC Cost</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Google PPC cost can differ so wildly it&#8217;s impossible to give you even a rough idea of what you could expect to pay per click. Luckily, the Google AdWords tool can tell you though. By searching for a keyword and its click-through value, you&#8217;ll be able to see which keywords are suitable for your budget</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If Google AdWords PPC management sounds like a daunting task, you always have the option of outsourcing the job to the professionals. Those with experience of running such campaigns will be able to help you maximize your revenue while cutting down your advertising budget. As many people are unfamiliar with the little nuisances of a campaign, outsourcing is usually a popular choice</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Google is the world's most visited website. Out of all of the sites that currently reside on the world wide web, Google gets more visits than all of them.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en/google-seo/google-seo/בלוג-שיווק/">SEO Services Company</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en">Everest</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The search engine attracts close to 1.17 billion visitors. These visitors come from all over the world, and live in countries large and small.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With such expansive reach, it&#8217;s no surprise online marketers are desperate to appear high up within the platform&#8217;s ranking system.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">A Google SEO Guide</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recently, Google SEO updates Panda and Penguin came into existence, changing the way the search engine operated forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These updates meant that, now, highly engaging content was more important than ever before. Organic links rather than paid links also took center stage, as did keyword research.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Suddenly, a site had to be of the highest quality to impress Google.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Google Mobile SEO</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Panda and Penguin kept web users busy, but it wasn&#8217;t long until a new update was to change their lives. The rise in mobile internet users meant that Google had to take smaller devices much more seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The company started to prioritize responsive websites. Soon, businesses were flocking in their millions to have Google SEO services that were mobile relevant performed for their sites. They wanted to find their way back to the top of the tree again after losing their spot there thanks to the changes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Advantage of Google SEO</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over a trillion searches are carried out on Google every year. Each of these searches directs an internet user to a list of sites Google believes will interest them. Naturally, the user clicks one of these sites and spends their time or money there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The higher a business is able to rank for a certain search term, the more chance they have of being the site the user chooses to visit. SEO Google Analytics tools show conclusively that the higher you rank on Google, the more visitors you get.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Naturally, ranking highly on Google is great for brand image too. Visitors view your site as more reputable, and perceive you to be an authority in your niche. This is vital if you&#8217;re selling products or services or writing on a particular topic.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Google SEO Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one downside when it comes to Google SEO services is the difficulty involved in running a successful campaign. It requires a lot of knowledge and expertise to get a site ranking highly on Google, something the average online market doesn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fortunately though, there are expert Google SEO services around ready to help your site reach its full potential. Best of all, when using such a service, the risk of Google penalties reduces considerably, too. Being inexperienced or using outdated methods can sometimes cause your site to get banned from the search engine by Google – a serious penalty, one which can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s only recommended you run a campaign yourself if you know how. If not, let those with the knowledge and appropriate Google SEO tools do the job for you.</p>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.everests.co.il/en/?p=1686</guid>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Official statistics show that Facebook has around 968 million daily users (correct as of July 2015). Very few other sites on the web can compete with such impressive figures. In fact, only Google, YouTube, Yahoo and Amazon even come close.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps that&#8217;s why more and more people are turning to Facebook to market their products and services. With so many potential consumers just waiting to be discovered on there, this social media site is a veritable gold mine waiting to be mined.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Why Facebook is a Great Place to Market Your Business</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While much of Facebook&#8217;s appeal is down to the number of visitors using the site, there are other good reasons to use it for online marketing, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In recent years, Facebook has developed its service to be more business-friendly. As a result, having a Facebook business page is now a necessity if you trade online. The investment in Facebook advertising has also enticed more retailers to use the platform to advertise on. With such a vast array of people using the service, it&#8217;s a great place to test out some of your most successful advertising techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Getting started on Facebook couldn&#8217;t be easier. It takes just moments to create an account, and not too much longer to optimize one for success. Of course, regular communication with customers will still be required, but this is true for every social media marketing- or digital marketing campaign.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Developing a Successful Facebook Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facebook&#8217;s biggest advantage can also be it&#8217;s disadvantage. The amount of people using the platform daily means there&#8217;s much competition for attention. Games, news, pictures, status updates, ads, videos and more all compete against your business for the recognition of others. That means, Facebook marketing strategies really ought to be well thought out if they&#8217;re to be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any strategy needs to focus on understanding potential customers and what they desire so that a solution to their problems can be offered. This strategy should also focus on being as engaging as possible. Engaging content is likely to get liked and shared, which is key if you&#8217;re set on improving customer engagement levels.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Facebook Marketing Tips</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to be a success on Facebook, there are several bits of advice worth taking note of.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, treat Facebook marketing like any digital marketing campaign. Go in with a strategy. Know who your campaign is aimed at, and make sure you&#8217;ve done enough research to know what the market needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Second, try to capture your audience&#8217;s attention. Whether you&#8217;re using Facebook ads or writing on your Facebook business page, this applies. Make your content short, snappy and to the point. Solve problems, meet needs, and entertain followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is usually enough to get the ball rolling. Of course, if you want further information, you can always ask the experts at your favorite online marketing agency to help you out.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>There are many stats that matter to an online marketer. Click-through-rate, for example, and page views. But arguably, no stat is more important than conversion rate.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en/conversion-rate/conversion-rate/בלוג-שיווק/">Conversion Rate Optimization</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en">Everest</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Conversion rate, you see, tells the story of your business. Your online conversions not only validate your marketing strategy, they also put money into your pocket – and isn&#8217;t that the whole point of any web venture? They tell you whether you&#8217;re doing something well or not, and allow you to change course if need be.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Taking the Guesswork Out of Selling</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everybody has their own idea as to what makes a successful website, sales letter, or product portfolio. Browse online forums and you&#8217;ll see marketers debate furiously over the right and wrong way to sell on the internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While opinion is always valuable in any industry, what ultimately matters is facts. Thankfully, online conversions can&#8217;t be argued with, and can provide you with all the data you need to analyze your business.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What are Conversion Rates?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you&#8217;re a marketing novice or a seasoned pro, conversion rates are something you&#8217;ll be able to understand right off the bat. That&#8217;s because the formula for working them out is so simple.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your ecommerce conversion rate, for example, is worked out by dividing the number of sales you made by the number of visitors to your site, then multiplying that figure by a hundred. If 100 people viewed your site today but only 4 people bought something from you, your conversion rate would be 4%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The higher your conversion rate, the better. Although, if your traffic is low, this figure can be misleading at first.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">How Knowing Your Conversion Rate Can Help You</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In sales, small increases in conversion rates can produce profound results. If you have a website generating thousands of views per day, increasing your conversion rate by a percentage point or two will increase your revenue significantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By knowing your current conversion rate for a particular product or service, you&#8217;ll be able to decipher whether your venture is performing as well as it should be. If it isn&#8217;t, changes need to be made for the sake of your balance sheet. You may choose to abandon a particular product range if it&#8217;s not selling. You may choose to advertise to a different market. You may even choose to tinker with your website design or your sales copy.  In some instances, when you&#8217;re confused as to how to increase your conversion rates, you may want to visit the conversion rate experts.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">How Conversion Rate Experts Can Help You</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you need help with conversion rate optimization, it&#8217;s nothing to be embarrassed about. Many of the world&#8217;s biggest businesses such as Apple, Sony and Microsoft enlist the help of such specialists every year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An expert who has the knowledge and experience to turn clicks into customers has the potential to skyrocket your sales. These experts will help you make any changes needed to your website to allow you to sell more products. They&#8217;ll also teach you many top secret methods to improve conversion rates, used by some of the most profitable online businesses. Best of all, the service often pays for itself. The increased sales that happen as a result of conversion rate optimization almost always covers the cost of this professional service.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Several years ago, designing and maintaining a website used to be extremely difficult. A person needed to know code or needed to have expensive pieces of software such as Dreamweaver in order to be able to create something good.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en/wordpress-website/web-development/בלוג-שיווק/">Web Development Company</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.everests.co.il/en">Everest</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Nowadays, the process of creating and managing a website is a lot easier thanks to a fairly new service called WordPress. By using themes and templates, a person is able to create a website for free, or at least a lot cheaper than it would have cost otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can imagine, powering your website using WordPress has numerous benefits. Here are several of the most popular.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">You Can Manage Your Site Anywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because WordPress is browser-based, you can carry out your WordPress website development from anywhere in the world. Anywhere with an internet connection is OK when it comes to managing and maintaining your site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A regular site requires you to have all your files on hand in order to edit things. With so many people working on the go now, that can be a major inconvenience.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">WordPress is SEO Friendly</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because WordPress sites function pretty much on a what-you-see-is-what-you-get basis, the code that gets them working is very clean. Google, and the other search engines, love clean code. WordPress sites are often looked upon favorably because of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sites designed from scratch using HTML can often be very buggy and difficult to use, especially in the beginning. This often means they fall out of favor with the major search engines.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">WordPress is Cost Effective</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A WordPress website cost can vary depending on what it is you need. For example, a simple site using a simple theme will often be free. These sites will be very basic, but they&#8217;ll do a job in some cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you need something more sophisticated, you can of course increase the amount of money you pay so you receive a superior product. Usually the WordPress website development cost will only be the amount of money you paid your service provider to edit your theme or make changes to your page.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Your Own Blog is Just Waiting for You</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest advantages of using the WordPress service is having your very own blog built into your site, ready to go. As blogs hold so much SEO potential, it really is great to have one attached to your WordPress site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only does this save you the cost of expanding your HTML site, it also saves you time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">WordPress is Easy to Use</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Building a website with WordPress couldn&#8217;t be easier. You control virtually every aspect of your site, so you can make changes you think are relevant with ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s one of WordPress&#8217; biggest attractions. Web users new and old can get their hands on their very own website in no time at all. This website will not only be functional but ready for business. Very few other services can offer such a competitive product.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Your website says a lot about you. It tells a visitor what it is you do. It tells them how up to date you are on current trends. It even tells them whether or not you pay attention to the little details.</p>
<p>Nowadays, so many people use the internet to shop and search for businesses. A well-designed, functional website has never been more important.</p>
<p>While many people disagree on what makes the perfect website, there are several design standards that you really should adhere to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Readable Fonts</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you&#8217;re embarking on a personal web design- or ecommerce web design project, one thing remains constant: You&#8217;ll need people to read what it is you write on your site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One mistake people make is opting for small fonts or those that are unreadable. When choosing yours, remember to consider tablet and mobile users. Also make sure your fonts contrast from your site&#8217;s background. Green on green, for example, just won&#8217;t work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Responsive Browsing</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While on the subject of mobile users, it&#8217;s now vital that you commit to responsive web design. Last year, research showed more people browsed the web on their mobile than they did on their desktop computer. That means, if your site isn&#8217;t responsive, you&#8217;re essentially alienating 50% of your customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only that, but you&#8217;ll be punished by Google if your site isn&#8217;t responsive. As of 2015, expect your search ranking on Google Mobile to fall if you&#8217;re still using a static site.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The 5-Second Rule</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The attention span of your average visitor is so short they won&#8217;t even have looked at your whole home page before clicking away. While that might sound demoralizing, especially when you&#8217;re paying money to a web design agency to make you a nice site, that&#8217;s just how things are online.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always recommended you put your best foot forward. Have a great offer? Put it at the very top of your page, don&#8217;t leave it right to the end – people are unlikely to ever see it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Stay Fresh</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many of the world&#8217;s top businesses change their websites frequently. McDonald&#8217;s, Nike, and Microsoft are just some of the major brands to change their site&#8217;s appearance this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By keeping your website fresh, you encourage visitors to keep visiting. You also earn yourself a second chance with those who may have clicked away from your site before. Chances are they don&#8217;t remember visiting you, so your web design agency can give you another bite of that lucrative cherry.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Include Social Media</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These days, web design and development is as much about creating something functional as it is about creating something beautiful. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always recommended you incorporate social media links on your page. If you don&#8217;t know how or you&#8217;re outsourcing the design project, ask your web design agency to do it for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Social media links not only help you improve your exposure, they also benefit you when it comes to SEO, too.</strong></p>
